# What is this repository? #
 it's a collection of tools i've made and or are making for my game projects in godot that i've refactored and made into templates which are licensed under creative commons and you can use them for free (crediting me is appreciated)<br>
<br>each "tool" will contain documentation in itself in the form of note comments.<br>
<br>but yeah i am **NOT** obligated to tweak these for anybody's special needs in the form of "new features", if it does not fit my vision i am **NOT** adding it.
